## :spiral_notepad: Project Overview

**Objective**  
<p align="justify">
The objective of this project is to develop a web application that simulates and visualizes the job sequencing algorithm used in scheduling and optimization. <strong>JOBSENSE</strong> serves as an interactive educational platform, helping users understand how the job sequencing algorithm prioritizes tasks, optimizes scheduling, and demonstrates real-world applications of efficient job allocation.
<p>

## :old_key: Features

- **Educational Content**: Provides detailed explanations of job sequencing algorithms and scheduling principles.
- **Simulation Tool**: An interactive tool that allows users to input job details (e.g., name, duration, profit) or generate random job data to visualize job scheduling.
- **Quiz Interface**: Interactive quizzes that enable users to test their understanding by arranging or selecting job sequences.
- **Progress Tracking**: Utilizes local storage to track user progress, quiz scores, and simulation results, offering feedback on achievements and areas for improvement.

---

## :gear: Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for creating the user interface and interactive features.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express – for handling API requests, business logic, and database interactions.
- **Database**: Firebase – used for storing user progress, quiz scores, and simulation data.
- **API**: REST API – enables dynamic content retrieval for educational sections and job data.
- **Hosting**: Web server or cloud hosting platform – to deploy and serve the application to users.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub – for collaborative development and version management.

## 	:desktop_computer: Usage

To use **JOBSENSE** effectively, follow these instructions:

1. **Educational Content**: Navigate to the educational section on the home page to learn about job sequencing algorithms and scheduling principles.

2. **Simulation Tool**: Use the simulation tool to input job details such as job name, duration, and profit. You can also choose to generate random job data to see how the job sequencing algorithm prioritizes and schedules tasks.

3. **Quiz Interface**: Test your knowledge on job sequencing with interactive quizzes. Arrange or select job sequences to check your understanding of scheduling optimization.

4. **Progress Tracking**: View your learning progress, quiz scores, and simulation results. Your progress is stored locally, so you can return later to see your achievements and areas for improvement.

5. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work across different devices and browsers for a seamless experience.
